           <h4>Congress & Senate</h4>
    </div>
    <div class="panel-body">
        <h3>Congress</h3>
        <p>The Congress of the United States is the legislative, or lawmaking, branch of the
         federal government. It is a bicameral legislature, which means that it is made up of two chambers, or houses. They are the House of Representatives and the Senate.
        The U.S. Constitution gives the two houses similar powers. The most important of these is that
         no law can be adopted unless it is first passed in identical form by a majority 
        (more than half) of the members of each house. A legislature made up of two chambers 
        supports the system of checks and balances that is built into the American form of 
        government. Either house is able to block legislation approved by the other. 
        Therefore, the two houses must often cooperate with each other and compromise
         on their differences in writing the nation's laws.
</p>
        <h4>Senate</h4>
        <p>
        The senate is comprised of 100 members, with two individuals representing each of
         the 50 states. Each senator is elected to a six year term, and can serve an unlimited
         amount of terms.   The Senate has special responsibility for the ratification, or 
        approval, of treaties with foreign countries. The Constitution requires that 
        "two thirds of the Senators present concur" (agree) for a treaty to be ratified. 
        This gives the Senate more influence than the House in foreign policy matters. 
        In addition, candidates nominated by the president for such positions as cabinet 
        members, ambassadors, and federal judges require approval by the Senate.The vice 
        president of the United States presides over the Senate.
        </p>

        <h4>House of Representatives</h4>
        <p>
            House of Representatives The House of Representatives has 435 members, or one elected from 
            each congressional district, which is approximately  It is thus more than four times the 
            size of the Senate, which has 100 members, or two elected from each state. The House of
            Representatives (commonly known as the House) is presided over by the Speaker of the House,
            who is nominated by the majority political party in that chamber.  Members are elected to a 
            two year term of service. On the other hand, the House has a special role in tax legislation.
             All bills for raising revenue must originate in the House of Representatives.Congress also 
            has a number of other responsibilities and powers. It can propose amendments to the 
            Constitution and declare war. The House of Representatives has the power to impeach, or 
            bring charges against, federal officials for misconduct. If no candidate in a presidential 
            election wins a majority in the electoral college, the president is elected by the House of 
            Representatives. The Congress also determines if a president.
